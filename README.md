B3 IP Ban Plugin for BigBrotherBot
=================================
**By clearskies**

## Description

Allows b3 to handle IP banning as opposed to the game. IP range ban support will be added in the future. Also supports limiting the number of client connections from one IP address.

This plugin works with the iourt41 parser, I'm not sure about any intricacies the other parsers may have.

### Installing the plugin

* Copy **ipban.py** into **b3/extplugins**
* Import **mapcycle.sql** into your b3 database
* Load the plugin in your **b3.xml** configuration file
